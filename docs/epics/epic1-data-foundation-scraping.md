# Epic 1: Data Foundation & Scraping

## Goal/Story

Create a comprehensive dataset of Linz's tech community events, venues, and opportunities using real scraped data to populate the MVP demo. This epic establishes the data foundation that makes the platform immediately useful and credible to community members by showing actual local events, venues, and coordination needs.

The scraped data will demonstrate real-world value while providing a realistic testing environment for all platform features. Using actual community data rather than generic examples will significantly improve demo impact and user validation.

## Considerations

- **GDPR Compliance**: Only scrape publicly available event information, respect robots.txt, implement data retention policies
- **Data Quality**: Ensure scraped data is clean, deduplicated, and properly categorized  
- **Community Context**: Focus on Linz-specific tech events, venues, and organizations
- **MVP Scope**: Balance comprehensive coverage with development timeline constraints
- **Maintenance**: Design scraping processes to be maintainable and updateable

## Tasks

### Epic 1.1: Data Source Research & Strategy
- [ ] Identify some data sources (Meetup.com, university event pages, company sites)
- [ ] Choose some Linz tech communites for the MVP (15-20 active groups)
- [ ] Document some venues/hosts/regular locations
- [ ] Analyze existing event categorization and topics

### Epic 1.2: Core Data Models
- [ ] Design Community/Organization model (Rust Meetup, Game Dev Linz, etc.)
- [ ] Design Event model with status levels (tentative, confirmed, etc.)
- [ ] Design Venue model with capabilities and contact info
- [ ] Design Speaker Opportunity model with topics and requirements
- [ ] Think about database migration scripts
- [ ] Implement data validation and constraints

### Epic 1.3: Event Data Scraping
- [ ] Scrape / collect enough data for the MVP
- [ ] Gather major conference and community event data

### Epic 1.4: Venue Data Collection
- [ ] Catalog ~10 primary tech venues (co-working spaces, company offices)
- [ ] Document ~20 secondary venues (universities, public spaces, makerspaces)
- [ ] Collect venue specifications (capacity, A/V, WiFi, catering options)
- [ ] Map hosting policies and contact information
- [ ] Create venue categorization system
- [ ] Establish venue data update workflow

### Epic 1.5: Community & Speaker Opportunity Synthesis
- [ ] Analyze common speaking topics from scraped events
- [ ] Create realistic speaker opportunity examples
- [ ] Identify active speakers and presentation patterns
- [ ] Map sponsor relationships and recurring partnerships
- [ ] Generate sample community coordination scenarios
- [ ] Create data seeding scripts for demo environment

### Epic 1.6: Data Quality & Maintenance
- [ ] Implement data validation and cleanup procedures
- [ ] Create duplicate detection algorithms
- [ ] Establish data refresh and update strategies
- [ ] Build monitoring for data staleness
- [ ] Document manual data curation processes
- [ ] Create data export/backup procedures

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Database contains realistic Linz tech event data
- [ ] 10+ primary venues documented with complete details
- [ ] 20+ secondary venues catalogued with basic information
- [ ] Speaker opportunity examples reflect actual community needs
- [ ] Data models support all planned MVP features
- [ ] Scraping processes are documented and maintainable
- [ ] Demo environment populated with compelling, realistic data
- [ ] GDPR compliance verified for all scraped content
