# Epic 0: Planning & Documentation

## Goal/Story

Establish a solid foundation for the linz.community project by creating comprehensive, publicly accessible documentation that enables community contribution and transparent development. This epic ensures all architectural decisions, project vision, and development processes are clearly documented before active development begins.

The documentation will serve as the single source of truth for contributors, community stakeholders, and future maintainers, enabling effective handoff and sustainable volunteer-driven development.

## Considerations

- **Documentation Strategy**: All documentation lives in repository as Markdown files ([ADR-006](../adr/adr006-documentation-strategy.md))
- **Open Development**: Project planning and progress should be transparent to build community trust
- **Volunteer Sustainability**: Clear processes and guidelines essential for community contributions
- **MIT License**: Open source approach enables community ownership and contribution

## Relevant Documentation

- [Main README](../../README.md) - Project overview and vision
- [ADR-006: Documentation Strategy](../adr/adr006-documentation-strategy.md)
- [Repository Structure Guidelines](../guides/repository-structure.md) *(to be created)*
